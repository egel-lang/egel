# printing large terms makes egel run out of the c stack

# when large objects go out of scope they might trigger a c stack overflow
# there isn't much there can be done about this since this is due to 
# native c++ RAII behavior on shared pointers
# a stopgap solution is to break these large structure down gracefully
