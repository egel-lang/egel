Optional libraries for Egel
---------------------------

These are the optional libraries for the Egel interpreter. They
compile against an already installed runtime.

At the moment, there are two packages:

- erpc, remote procedure calls
- python (defunct), python bindings
- lightning (not maintained), a failed experiment with a JIT
